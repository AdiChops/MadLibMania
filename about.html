        <h2 id="info">You may be wondering how we made MadLib Mania ü§î</h2>
        <p>Well, there are three main things to know about this to make your own version of MadLib Mania: </p>

        <h3>Display with HTML/CSS</h3>
        <p>All the work to display and style what you see on this page was done with HTML and CSS. These words may mean nothing to you right now, but put simply, HTML is a markup language that allows browsers to display content. CSS is a language that allows you to style that content that the browser is showing you!</p>
        <p>To learn more about HTML and CSS, you can take <a href="https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-html">this course by GitHub Learning Labs</a>, and/or you can use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">this resource offered by W3Schools.</a></p>

        <h3>Logic with JavaScript</h3>
        <p>This is the more complex part. In simple terms, JavaScript is, like Python, a programming language that allows us to add some logic to our basic HTML pages. It allows us to do more beyond just displaying information.</p>
        <p>To learn more about JavaScript, you can use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">this resource offered by W3Schools.</a> Please keep in mind that JavaScript is a bit more complex to learn than Python, so it's normal to be confused and feel overwhelmed at first.</p>

        <h3>Deploying/Hosting the Website with GitHub Pages</h3>
        <p>GitHub Pages is what's being used to have this website up on the web! GitHub is an Internet hosting provider for the version control software Git.
            You may be wondering what all this mumbo jumbo even means. A version control software is software that helps manage and track changes to software code.
            It makes collaboration and code management so much easier. On its own, Git tracks sofware changes on the repository, but it only works locally where the repository exists.
            That's where GitHub comes in. GitHub allows you to view and manage your repositories online, allowing multiple people to use that repository and also allowing easy access to the latest code (like Google Docs).
        </p>
        <p>To learn more about GitHub, you can take <a href="https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github">this course by GitHub Learning Labs.</a></p>
        <p>Once you've completed that course and learned about GitHub, you can take <a href="https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages">this course</a> to learn about deployment and hosting with GitHub Pages.</p>
